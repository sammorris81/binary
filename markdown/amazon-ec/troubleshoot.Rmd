# Troubleshooting

Right now, the problem appears to be with consistency between the IDs and the weights.
If a site is beyond the cutoff, the weight should be set to 0, and the site should not be included in IDs.
However, if the site is within the cutoff, the weight should be > 0, and the site should be included in IDs.
At some point in the MCMC, there is inconsistency between IDs and weights.

At iteration 201 something weird happens.
